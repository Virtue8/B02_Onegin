Okay let's go
These bitches playin' games I ain't fallin for no hoe
I be catching flights got no time i gotta go
I be swerving through the city my eyes real low
I can't get no sleep yeah i gotta get this dough

I been on my grind for the years
I might buy my momma house so she'll never shed a tear
Bitch i'm destined for this shit, I ain't got no time for spare
Cold nights in my city, blowing smoke, bitch i'm busy like
